# Week 1 of Mackenzie's 12 in 12 Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build 1 app per week for 12 weeks.
The first app we built here is a simple Reddit clone where by users can:
- Add links
- Upvote / Downvote links
- Add comments

The basic users auth /permissions were set up using devise. 
Voting uses the acts_as_votable gem.
